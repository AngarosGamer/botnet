## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Functions

**Server**
- Manages the connection of multiple clients
- Web interface with Mongoose to monitor activity
- Server command line interface for direct interaction
- File exchange (upload/download)
- Activity logging (`main.log`)
     **Web_Server**
    - HTML/CSS/JS user interface
    - View connected bots
    - Control and send commands


**Client**
- Listens to and executes commands sent by the server
- File transfer
- Handles client errors
- Locally stored messages

## üîß Compilation

The project uses **CMake** to compile :

In order to compile, you will need to have installed the following librairies installed on your machine:
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake clang libcunit1-dev libcunit1-doc libcmocka-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev curl libcurl4-openssl-dev

```

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B .
cmake --build .
```

---
## üöÄ Execution

The project currently uses dynamic linking for external libraries. This means that some libraries need to be installed on the system prior to starting the server / client.

```bash
- apt-get update && apt-get install -y libcmocka-dev
- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- ldconfig
```
#### Running the Server
```bash
./build/server
```
#### Running the Client
```bash
./build/client -a <server_ip> -p <port>
```

See command line arguments below for more information.

## Librairies

cURL (call one l'API for command line interface),
cJSON (webserver & console use it for data transmission),
cMocka (tests),
ncurses (to beautify the command line interface),
mongoose (for the webserver)
